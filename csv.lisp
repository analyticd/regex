;; csv.lsp -- Comma Separated Textfile (CSV) File Reader
;;
;; This module reads CSV files line by line and returns a list of CSV groups
;; with each line split into separate items within each group.
;; A CSV group is identified as all those lines between lines containing 
;; only '(' and ')'. Empty lines are elided.
;;
;; The routine attempts to guess whether to use CSV (comma) or
;; TSV (tab) splitting.
;;
;; The returned result from READ-FILE is an association list of groups,
;; with each group containing an association list of columns identified by
;; column heading strings. Each column heading is accompanied by the
;; column vector of strings or numbers, depending on the data type declared
;; in the line following the column headers.
